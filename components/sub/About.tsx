                I am an aspiring software developer with a keen interest in
                crafting UI/UX and exploring the bridge between technology and
                design.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                I'm looking to expand my horizons, build on my full-stack
                development skills and I am currently learning about machine
                learning and cloud development.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
                In my free time, I like playing Minecraft with friends and speed
                typing. When I'm away from my computer, I enjoy basketball and
                ultimate frisbee as well as Rubik's cube solving.
