                I am a passionate software developer very interested in bridging
                the gap between beautiful UI/UX and high-performance
                development.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                I am currently working on expanding my full-stack development
                skills while teaching myself machine learning and cloud
                development.

                In my free time, I can be found playing Minecraft or on
                Monkeytype. I also enjoy playing basketball, soccer, and
                ultimate frisbee, and I'm trying to get into the gym more
                consistently.
